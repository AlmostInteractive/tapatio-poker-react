# Tapatio Poker
A simple card game that can be played with a standard 52 card deck. This version lets you play aginst a CPU opponent in a React SPA.

## How to play

- Each player draws five cards then selects three to keep, the rest being discarded. 
- One card is chosen and played face-down. When both players have selected a card, both are revealed. 
- The player with the highest face-value card gains a point. No points are gained for a tie. (Aces count as 'one'.)
- Once all three cards are played and points tallied, each player's score is incremented by the number of points they won **except in the case of 3 points**. If a player wins all three points, she instead loses three from her score (minimum of zero).
- The first player to 10 points wins. If both players pass 10 points on the same turn, the highest score wins. If both players have the same score, the game is a tie.
